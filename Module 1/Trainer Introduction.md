Hey, Iâ€™m Siddh ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Iâ€™m someone who loves tinkering with tech, breaking things (and fixing them back again ðŸ˜…), and sharing whatever I learn along the way. This blog is where I write about Linux, servers, cybersecurity, and all the random experiments I do with Raspberry Pi and other projects. Think of it as my open notebook â€” if I learn something cool, youâ€™ll probably find it here. Hopefully, it helps you out or sparks an idea of your own! ðŸš€
