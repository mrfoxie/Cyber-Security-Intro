| ðŸ§Š Myth                                                | ðŸ”¥ Reality                                                                             |

| Cybersecurity is ITâ€™s job, not mine.                   | Human error causes **90%+** of breaches â€” everyone plays a role.                       |
| Hackers only target big companies.                     | Small & medium businesses are **prime targets** â€” easier to breach.                    |
| Strong antivirus software is enough.                   | Antivirus helps, but it's **not foolproof** â€” phishing & social engineering bypass it. |
| I can tell a scam when I see one.                      | Modern phishing is **highly convincing**, and even trained users get tricked.          |
| My data isnâ€™t valuable.                                | All data is valuable â€” even **your email account** can be used for attacks.            |
| Using public Wi-Fi is safe if I donâ€™t log in anywhere. | Hackers can **intercept traffic** and inject malware silently.                         |
| Iâ€™ve never been hacked, so I must be secure.           | Most people donâ€™t know theyâ€™ve been compromised â€” until itâ€™s too late.                 |
