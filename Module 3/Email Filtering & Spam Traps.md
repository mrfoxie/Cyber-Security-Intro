## 📤 **What Is Email Filtering?**

- 🔍 It’s an automated system that **analyzes incoming emails** to detect:
	- 📎 Suspicious attachments
	- 🔗 Malicious or shortened links
	- 👤 Spoofed sender addresses
	- 🔤 Poor grammar or phishing keywords
	- 📬 Mass-mail behavior

> ✅ **Good emails go to Inbox**
> 🚫 **Suspicious ones go to Spam or get blocked entirely**

## **What Are Spam Traps?**

> Spam traps are **decoy email addresses** used by email providers or cybersecurity teams to catch spammers and scammers.

Types of Spam Traps:

| Trap Type           | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Honeypot Emails** | Emails never used by real people. Any mail received = spam.               |
| **Recycled Traps**  | Old, abandoned emails repurposed to detect bulk emailing.                 |
| **Typo Traps**      | Common misspelled addresses (e.g., `gmial.com`) to catch sloppy phishers. |

🚫 If your domain sends emails to spam traps, your domain/IP may get **blacklisted**!

## 🛡️ **Best Practices for Users:**

- [ ] Don’t mark legit emails as spam (to avoid false positives)
- [ ] Report phishing instead of just deleting
- [ ] Don’t reply to or click links in spam
- [ ] Use **company email** only for work — never register it on shady sites
