## 🧨 **Common Dangerous File Types:**

| 📂 File Type           | 💣 Risk                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **.zip**               | Can contain multiple hidden malware files, scripts, ransomware, or trojans                   |
| **.pdf**               | May include malicious links, auto-run scripts, or exploit outdated PDF readers               |
| **.doc/.docx (Word)**  | Can include dangerous **macros** that execute malware when you enable "Editing" or "Content" |
| **.xls/.xlsm (Excel)** | Often used for **macro-based ransomware and info-stealers**                                  |
| **.exe / .scr / .bat** | Directly executable programs — often blocked, but deadly when opened                         |

## 🕵️‍♂️ **Tricks Attackers Use:**

- Filename obfuscation: `Invoice.pdf.exe`
- Using urgency: _“Salary Slip Attached”_, _“Invoice Due Today!”_
- Sending from spoofed contacts (e.g., boss@company.com)
- Password-protected ZIPs (to bypass antivirus scanning)

## 🛡️ **How to Stay Safe:**

- [ ] Never open attachments from unknown or unexpected sources
- [ ] Be wary of urgent or emotional language in emails
- [ ] Don’t enable macros unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe
- [ ] When in doubt — verify the sender by calling or messaging directly
- [ ] Use up-to-date antivirus and open documents in **protected view**
