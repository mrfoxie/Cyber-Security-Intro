## 🔗🕵️ **Hover Link vs Real URL – Spot the Trap!**
> Phishing emails often **disguise dangerous links** to make them appear trustworthy.  
> But when you **hover** your mouse over them, the **real destination** is revealed.

Example:
- **Visible Text in Email:**  🔗 `https://www.mybank.com/login`
- **Real URL When Hovered:**  🔗 `http://mybank.verify-login.ru/fakepage`

>💡 _Looks real at first glance... but it’s a trap!_

## 🔍 **How to Check Links Safely:**

- On **desktop**:
	- Hover your mouse over the link without clicking.
	- Look at the **bottom-left corner** of your browser or email window to see the actual URL.
- On **mobile**:
	- Press and hold the link until a preview or full link appears.
	- Don’t tap blindly.
