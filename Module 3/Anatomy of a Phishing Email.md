## 📧 **Anatomy of a Phishing Email – Spot the Red Flags**
> Phishing emails are **designed to look legit**, but they often have clues that give them away. Here’s what to look for:


## 1. Suspicious Sender Address

- Example: `security@amaz0n-support.net`
- 👉 Look closely: Spelling tricks, fake domains, or unfamiliar addresses
## **2. Urgent or Threatening Language**

- “Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!”
- 👉 Tries to create panic or pressure to act fast

## 3. Generic Greeting

- “Dear Customer,” instead of using your real name
- 👉 Legit services usually personalize communication

## 4. Fake or Mismatched Links

- Text says `https://yourbank.com`, but when you hover, the link goes to `http://malicious-site.ru/login`
- 👉 Always hover over links to verify before clicking

## 5. Unexpected Attachments

- PDFs, ZIPs, or Excel files with macros
- 👉 Common way to deliver malware or ransomware

## 6. Poor Grammar or Odd Formatting

- “Your accoun has been suspeneded please verify now.”
- 👉 Not typical of real professional communications

## 7. Too Good to Be True

- “Congratulations! You’ve won ₹50,000 Amazon gift card!”
- 👉 Scammers use greed to bait you into clicking
