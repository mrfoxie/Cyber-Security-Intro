| **Tool/Technology**                                                      | **Purpose**                                                                      |

| **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**                                        | Prevents spoofing by verifying sender IPs against authorized domain records.     |
| **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**                                    | Ensures email integrity by verifying the message wasn't altered in transit.      |
| **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)** | Combines SPF & DKIM to protect your domain and report abuse.                     |
| **Secure Email Gateways**                                                | Filters inbound/outbound emails for malware, phishing, and spam.                 |
| **Anti-Malware Scanners**                                                | Scans email attachments and links for known malicious content.                   |
| **Sandboxes**                                                            | Opens suspicious attachments/links in isolated environments to analyze behavior. |
| **Email Encryption**                                                     | Ensures sensitive data in emails can't be read by unauthorized users.            |
| **User Behavior Analytics**                                              | Detects unusual patterns in email interactions (e.g., sudden spike in emails).   |
