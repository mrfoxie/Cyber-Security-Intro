| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Urgency**            | “Your account will be deactivated in 30 minutes!”             |
| **Fear**               | “Suspicious login detected. Click here to verify.”            |
| **Greed / Rewards**    | “You’ve won ₹5,000. Claim now!”                               |
| **Authority Pressure** | “This is the CEO. I need this wire transfer immediately.”     |
| **Politeness Trap**    | “I’m from the new team — can you share the password, please?” |
| **Curiosity Hook**     | “Check out this leaked internal memo!”                        |

## **How to Defend Yourself:**

- [ ] **Pause and think** — real companies don’t pressure you instantly
- [ ] **Verify** requests through phone or in-person
- [ ] **Look for emotional triggers** — fear, rush, surprise
- [ ] **Report** any message that feels off, even slightly

> 💡 _If it makes you panic, pause. If it sounds too good, check twice._
