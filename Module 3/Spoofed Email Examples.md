## 📧🎭 **Spoofed Emails – Don’t Trust the Sender at First Glance**

> **Email spoofing** is when a hacker **fakes the “From” address** to make the email look like it came from someone you trust — like your boss, bank, or HR team.

---

## 🔍 Example 1: **Fake Boss Request**

**From:** `ceo@mystartup.co`  
**To:** `accounts@company.com`  
**Subject:** URGENT: Wire Transfer Required  
**Body:**

> "Please transfer ₹2,00,000 to this vendor today. This is highly confidential. I’m in a meeting and can’t take calls."

### ✅ **Red Flags:**
- Urgency
- Unusual money request
- Asking to avoid verification

## 🔍 **Example 2: Spoofed HR Email**

**From:** `hr-department@compaany.com` _(Note the typo!)_  
**To:** `employee@company.com`  
**Subject:** Action Required: Policy Update  
**Body:**

> "Please review the attached document regarding the new leave policy. Open the PDF and sign to confirm."


### ✅ **Red Flags:**
- Slightly misspelled sender domain
- Unexpected attachment
- Vague content 

## 🔍 **Example 3: Fake IT Support Email**

**From:** `itsupport@yourcompany-security.com`  
**Subject:** System Security Alert

> “Your account has shown suspicious activity. Click here to verify your credentials or your access will be disabled.”

### ✅ **Red Flags:**
- Fake security scare
- Urgency + action link
- Lookalike domain

## 🛡️ **How to Stay Safe:**

- [ ] Always verify unusual requests via a separate channel (call/message)
- [ ] Double-check email domains — **not just names**
- [ ] Never click suspicious links or download files from unknown senders
- [ ] When in doubt, report it to IT/security
