## 🧠⚠️ Common Vulnerabilities in Humans

_(Psychological Tricks Hackers Use)_

> Cybercriminals don’t always need code — they use **psychology** to bypass our defenses. Here are the most common **human weaknesses** they exploit:

1. **Urgency**
	- “**Act now or lose access!**”
	- Hackers create **pressure** so victims **act without thinking**.

2. **Authority**
	- “**I’m calling from your bank.**”
	- People tend to **obey** those who seem to be in **power** (**bosses, IT, police, HR**).

3. **Greed / Reward**
	- “**You’ve won a free iPhone!**”
	- **Too-good-to-be-true** offers **trick users** into **clicking malicious links**.

4. **Trust**
	- “**It’s from my friend/colleague, it must be safe.**”
	- Attackers **spoof known contacts** to **bypass suspicion**.

5. **Fear**
	- “**Your account has been compromised!**”
	- **Panic can override logic** — leading to **impulsive decisions**.

6. **Curiosity**
	- “**Confidential Salary Sheet Attached**”
	- **Tempting headlines** can **lure** users into **opening dangerous files or links**.

7. **Social Conformity / Politeness**
	- “**Hold the door for me, I forgot my badge.**”
	- **People avoid being rude** — even when they **feel suspicious**.
