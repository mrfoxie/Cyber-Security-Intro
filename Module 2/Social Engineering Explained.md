## 🎭 **Social Engineering – Hacking the Human Mind**

> **Social engineering** is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential information or performing risky actions — often without realizing it.

---


---

## **How It Works:**

Instead of attacking systems, attackers **exploit human psychology** — trust, fear, urgency, or curiosity — to bypass security.

## 🎯 **Common Social Engineering Tactics:**

| 🎭 **Technique** | **Description**                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phishing**     | Fake emails/SMS/links that trick users into revealing info                 |
| **Vishing**      | Voice-based phishing (e.g. fake calls from "bank" or "tech support")       |
| **Smishing**     | Phishing over SMS (e.g. fake OTP verification links)                       |
| **Pretexting**   | Attacker pretends to be someone else (e.g. HR, police, boss) to gain trust |
| **Baiting**      | Luring victims with free offers (e.g. infected USB labeled “Salary Sheet”) |
| **Tailgating**   | Gaining physical access by following someone into a secure area            |
| **Quid Pro Quo** | Offering something (like IT help) in exchange for sensitive info           |

## 📌 **Real-World Example:**

> An attacker calls posing as the company’s IT support, says:
> _“We detected a virus on your device. I need your login password to fix it.”_ 
> The employee, feeling pressured, gives access — and the system is breached.

## 🛡️ How to Defend Against It:

- [ ] Be skeptical of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls
- [ ] Never share passwords, OTPs, or personal info — even with “official” sounding people
- [ ] Verify requests via known official channels
- [ ] Think before clicking, reacting, or forwarding
- [ ] Report suspicious behavior to your IT/security team

> 💡 The strongest firewall can be defeated by one untrained employee. Awareness = defense.
