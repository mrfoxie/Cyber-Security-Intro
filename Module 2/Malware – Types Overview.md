| **Adware**       | Bombards you with unwanted ads or redirects — may also track you.                   |
| **Keylogger**    | Records every keystroke to steal passwords, chats, and financial info.              |
| **Rootkit**      | Hides deep in the system to give attackers remote access and control.               |
