## 🎣 **Baiting – The Curiosity Trap**

> **Baiting** lures the victim with something tempting — usually free or urgent — and tricks them into compromising security.

| **Tactic**                    | **What Happens**                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| USB labeled "Confidential"    | Victim plugs it in → hidden malware installs silently |
| Fake movie/song download      | User downloads → infected file opens backdoor         |
| "Free Wi-Fi" in public places | Attacker intercepts traffic, stealing login info      |

> 💡 _If it's free, it's bait._ Curiosity or greed is the hook.

## 🎭 **Pretexting – The Fake Identity Game**

> **Pretexting** involves the attacker **pretending to be someone trusted** to manipulate the victim into revealing information or granting access.

| **Tactic**                                  | **What Happens**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| “I’m from the IT team”                      | Requests login credentials to "fix an issue"      |
| “This is HR – we lost your PAN info”        | Asks for ID details under a fake company scenario |
| “Police need your laptop for investigation” | Uses authority pressure to access data            |

> 💡 _Pretexting plays on authority, urgency, and trust._
