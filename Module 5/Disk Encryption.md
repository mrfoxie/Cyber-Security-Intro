## ## Why Use Disk Encryption?

- Protects laptops/drives if **lost or stolen**
- Prevents **unauthorized access** even if the drive is removed
- Required for compliance (**GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS**)

## ## Best Practices

- Always use **strong passphrases**
- Backup your **recovery keys** securely
- Encrypt **external USB drives** too
- Don’t rely only on OS login → full disk encryption adds a **second layer** 
> **Remember:** _If your laptop is stolen but the drive is encrypted, the data stays safe. Without encryption, it’s an open book._
