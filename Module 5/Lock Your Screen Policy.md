## Why It Matters?
- - Unlocked screens are **open invitations** for data theft or misuse
- **Physical access = total control** over your session
- A few unattended minutes can lead to **security breaches**, **data leaks**, or **unauthorized actions**

---


---
## The Policy - Example Only
- - **Always lock your screen** when stepping away — even for a few seconds
- Use:
    - 🪟 **Windows**: `Win + L`
    - 🍎 **Mac**: `Control + Command + Q`
    - 🐧 **Linux**: `Ctrl + Alt + L` (varies by distro)

---


---
## Auto-Lock Settings (Recommended)
- **Set auto-lock** after **5 minutes** of inactivity
- Enforce password on wake or unlock
- Disable guest accounts or automatic login

---


---
## Best Practices
- Lock your screen **every time you leave**
- Use **strong session passwords** or **biometric login**
- **Never** leave sensitive data visible on-screen in public/shared spaces
- Encourage teammates to **lock up too** — security is a team effort!
