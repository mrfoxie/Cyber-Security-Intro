## Why It Matters

Even the strongest digital security is **useless** if someone walks away with your device.
- 🔓 Stolen device = **access to sensitive data**
- 🎯 Targets: Laptops, USB drives, external HDDs, mobile phones    
- 🏢 Especially risky in shared workspaces, cafes, travel, and conferences

## ### Threats
- **Theft or Loss** (left behind, stolen from bag/car/office)
- **Unauthorized Access** (when unattended or unlocked)
- **Data Extraction** from unencrypted drives
