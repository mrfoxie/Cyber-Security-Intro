## Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Give only the minimum access needed
- **Need-to-Know:** Share files only with people who require them
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions tied to job role, not individual requests

---

## Safe Practices

- 📁 Use **official company drives/portals** (OneDrive, Google Workspace, SharePoint, etc.)
- 🔒 Apply **read-only or restricted access** where possible
- ⏳ **Review & revoke** old permissions regularly
- 🛡️ Enable **encryption** when sharing externally
- 📧 Always **verify recipients** before sending files

## Common Mistakes

- Granting **“Everyone” access** to sensitive folders
- Using **personal cloud storage** (Dropbox, Gmail, WhatsApp)
- Forgetting to remove access for ex-employees
- Sharing files via **public/unsecured links**

>**Golden Rule:** _“If someone doesn’t absolutely need access, they shouldn’t have it.”_
