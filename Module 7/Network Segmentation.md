## What is it?

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into **smaller, isolated sections** (segments).

- Each segment has its own rules, controls, and security.
- This **limits the spread of cyberattacks** and improves performance.

---
## Why it matters?

- Stops hackers from moving freely across your network.
- Protects sensitive data (like finance or HR systems).
- Reduces the impact of malware/ransomware.
- Helps meet compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

## Types of Segmentation

1. **Physical Segmentation**
    - Separate hardware (switches, routers, firewalls).
    - Very secure, but costly.
2. **Logical Segmentation**
    - Uses VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), subnets, or software-defined networking (SDN).
    - Cheaper and flexible.

## Example Scenarios

- **Office Network**
    - Segment 1: Employee laptops
    - Segment 2: Guest Wi-Fi
    - Segment 3: Servers
    - Segment 4: Security devices (CCTV, IoT)
- **Company with Sensitive Data**
    - HR & Finance servers isolated from general employee access.
    - Developers’ test systems separated from production systems.

## Benefits

- ✅ Reduces cyberattack spread (ransomware locked in one zone).  
- ✅ Protects sensitive information.  
- ✅ Easier to monitor and control traffic.  
- ✅ Helps with compliance and audits.

## Quick Analogy

- **Flat Network (No Segmentation)** → Like a big open office with no walls; once a thief enters, they can move anywhere.
- **Segmented Network** → Like an office with locked rooms; the thief can’t just walk into HR, Finance, or the Server Room.

>**Key Takeaway**: Network segmentation = **divide & protect**. It ensures that even if one part is compromised, the rest stays safe.
