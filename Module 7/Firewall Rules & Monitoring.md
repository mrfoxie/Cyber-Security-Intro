## **Firewall Rules** 📜

Rules define what traffic is allowed or blocked:
- **Inbound Rules** ⬇️
    - Traffic **coming into** your network
    - Example: Allow email server connections, block everything else
- **Outbound Rules** ⬆️
    - Traffic **leaving** your network
    - Example: Block risky websites, allow business apps only
- **Port Rules** 🔌
    - Control which digital “doors” (ports) can send or receive data
    - Example: Open port 443 for HTTPS, block unused ports
- **Application Rules** 💻
    - Allow or block specific apps
    - Example: Allow Zoom ✅, block unauthorized file-sharing apps ❌      

>**Tip:** Rules are processed in order; the first match applies ⚡
