## 🟥 **Why Password Sharing is a BAD Idea**

### ⚠️ **Security Risks**
- Shared passwords can be **leaked or reused** in other places.
- **No control** over who else the person shares it with.    
- If an account is misused, **you won’t know who did it**.

### 🕵️ **No Accountability**
- Most systems log activities by user. If 5 people use the same password, there's **no traceability**.

### 📉 **Violates Policy**

- Many organizations **strictly prohibit** password sharing under IT policies or security standards.

## **When Password Sharing Happens?**

- Temporarily sharing streaming service passwords (e.g., Netflix)
- Teams sharing common logins for shared tools
- Parents accessing kids’ accounts

> 💬 _Just because it's common doesn't mean it's safe._

### **Secure Alternatives**

### ✅ Use a Password Manager:
- Tools like **Bitwarden, LastPass, KeePass** allow **secure sharing** without revealing the actual password.

### ✅ Role-Based Access:
- Give **limited access** instead of the whole account.
- Example: Grant **viewer rights** on Google Docs instead of sharing your login.

#### ✅ One-Time Passwords (OTPs):
- If you must share access, generate a **temporary code** instead of giving away the master password.

## **Bottom Line:**

> **Password sharing should be the exception, not the rule.**  
> Always prioritize **secure, traceable, and limited access.**
