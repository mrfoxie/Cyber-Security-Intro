## üõ°Ô∏è Strong Password Rules
> _"Your password is your first line of defense."_

## 1. **Make It Long**

- Minimum: **12 characters**
- Ideal: **16+ characters**
- Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack

### **Example:**  

‚úÖ `Th3QuickBr0wnF0xJumps!`  
‚ùå `fox123`

## 2. **Use a Mix of Character Types**

Include:

- **Uppercase (A‚ÄìZ)**
- **Lowercase (a‚Äìz)**
- **Numbers (0‚Äì9)**
- **Symbols (! @ # $ % ^ & _)**

### **Example:**  
‚úÖ `C0ffeeMug#2024!`  
‚ùå `coffeemug2024`

## 3. **Avoid Common Words or Patterns**

- No dictionary words alone (`password`, `admin`, `welcome`)
- Avoid keyboard patterns: `qwerty`, `123456`, `asdfgh`
- Avoid birthdates, pet names, phone numbers

## 4. **Don‚Äôt Use Personal Information**

- No names, birthdays, phone numbers, or addresses
- Attackers can easily gather these from social media or public records

## 5. **No Reuse Across Accounts**

- Every account should have a **unique** password
- If one service is breached, others remain safe

## 6. **Use Passphrases (for memorability)**

> Combine unrelated words with punctuation
> Easier to remember, harder to guess

### **Example:**
‚úÖ `BlueTiger!SkatesOnMars7`  
‚úÖ `Horse$Carrot_Dance!Sky`  
‚ùå `Tiger123`

## 7. **Use a Password Manager**

Remembering dozens of complex passwords is tough ‚Äî use tools like:

> üß† Bitwarden (Free/Open Source)
> üîê 1Password
> üíæ KeePassXC
> üß© Dashlane


> They generate and store strong passwords securely.

## 8. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**

- Even strong passwords can be compromised
- MFA adds a second layer (code, biometrics, key)
