## **What Is a Password Policy?**
> A **password policy** is a set of rules enforced by your organization to ensure that employee passwords are **strong**, **secure**, and **manageable**.

---


---
## **Typical Components of a Work Password Policy**
### ✅ **Minimum Length**
- At least **12 characters** (sometimes 8, but longer is better)

### 🔀 **Complexity Requirements**
- Must include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**

### ♻️ **Regular Changes**
- Passwords must be changed **every 60–90 days**    
- Some policies ban **reuse of old passwords** (e.g., last 5 remembered)

### 🚫 **No Common or Breached Passwords**
- Prevents using passwords like `Password123` or known leaked ones from breaches

### 🔒 **2FA/MFA Enforcement**
- Mandatory **multi-factor authentication** for high-privilege or remote accounts

### 👀 **Auto-Lock and Timeout**
- Devices auto-lock after inactivity, requiring reauthentication

## **Behind the Scenes (IT/Policy Side)**

- Passwords may be hashed using **strong algorithms    
- **Password audit tools** check for weaknesses or reuse across systems

---
## **Employee Responsibilities**
- Follow the rules – **don’t write down or share passwords**
- Report **suspicious activity or login alerts**    
- Use **company-approved password managers** if allowed
