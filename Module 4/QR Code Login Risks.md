## **What is QR Code Login?**

- Used by apps like WhatsApp Web, Discord, Instagram, etc.
- You scan a QR code shown on a website using your phone to log in automatically—**no password needed**.

## 🚨 **What Can Go Wrong?**

#### **1. Social Engineering Attacks**

- **Attackers trick you into scanning a malicious QR code** (sent via email, WhatsApp, fake websites).
- Once scanned, **they gain access to your account**—especially for apps that allow QR login (e.g., WhatsApp Web).

> _Example_: “Scan this code to win a prize!” — It secretly links your account to an attacker’s browser session.

#### **2. QR Code Hijacking**

- Public/shared computers can have QR codes pre-scanned.
- A malicious actor scans it before you do, gaining access to your account **without your knowledge**.

#### **3. Fake Login Pages**

- QR codes on phishing pages redirect to lookalike sites.
- **Victims think they're logging into the real service** — but credentials go to the hacker.

## 🛡️ **How to Stay Safe**

- Always verify the website URL before scanning
- Only scan QR codes from trusted sources
- Enable 2FA/MFA for extra protection
- Log out of devices you don’t recognize
- Use session alerts if the platform offers it (e.g., WhatsApp Web shows active devices)

## 🔐 Bottom Line:

> **QR code login is useful, but treat it like a password** — if shared or scanned from the wrong source, it **can be exploited.**
