## **Passphrases (Recommended)**

- Example: `PurpleTacoSkyDrive2025`
- Easy to remember
- Longer and more secure
- Supports entropy without confusing symbols
- Ideal length: 20+ characters
- Can be made using memorable stories or visuals

> 💡 _“Four random words are harder to crack than one complex word!”_

## ⚠️ **Complex Gibberish (Not Ideal for Humans)**

- **Example:** `B@5$!k29Jq#%X!`
- Hard to remember 😵
- Often written down or reused
- Typing errors lead to frustration
- Still **crackable** with brute force if short

## **Entropy Comparison (Bit Strength)**

#### 🔐 What Is Entropy in Passwords?

**Entropy** is a measure of **unpredictability or randomness** in a password.  
The **higher the entropy**, the **harder it is for attackers to guess or crack it** using brute-force or dictionary attacks.

#### **Think of It Like a Game of Guessing:**

- - If your password is short or uses **common words or patterns**, attackers can guess it **very quickly**.
- If it's long, unique, and unpredictable, it becomes **extremely hard to guess** — even for powerful computers.
#### ⚙️ **Why Does Passphrase Entropy Matter?**

Let’s say an attacker is using a **high-speed cracking tool** that can try **100 billion guesses per second**:
- A password with **30 bits of entropy** could be cracked in **minutes**.
- A password with **100 bits of entropy** would take **trillions of years** – even with future technology!

| Type                     | Approx. Entropy Bits | Crack Time*        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `Dog!23`                 | ~30 bits             | Seconds to minutes |
| `x7B$2kL!`               | ~45 bits             | Minutes to hours   |
| `BatteryHorseStapleFish` | ~100+ bits           | Trillions of years |

## 🛡️ **Bottom Line:**
> ✔ Use **passphrases**: long, memorable, and unique.
> ❌ Avoid complex gibberish unless using a **password manager**.
