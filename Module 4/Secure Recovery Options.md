## **Why Recovery Matters**

Even strong passwords can be forgotten. Secure recovery ensures:
- Only **you** can regain access
- Attackers **can’t exploit** the recovery process

## 🔐 **Secure Recovery Methods**

### 📧 **Verified Email**
- A recovery link is sent to your **pre-verified email**
- Must be protected with **2FA**

### 📱 **Phone-Based Recovery**
- **OTP sent via SMS** or **call** (shouldn’t be the only method)    
- Use **phone lock** and **SIM lock** for extra security

### 🔑 **Backup Codes**
- One-time use codes provided during 2FA setup    
- Store them **offline** in a secure location (e.g., printed, safe, encrypted USB)

### 📲 **Authenticator Apps (Recovery Key/Backup)**
- Some apps (e.g., Google Auth, Microsoft Authenticator) allow export or recovery setup    
- Important: **Secure your device** and **enable cloud backup** if available

### 🛠️ **Security Questions (Deprecated)**
- Often weak and guessable (e.g., “mother’s maiden name”)
- Many orgs are **phasing these out**
