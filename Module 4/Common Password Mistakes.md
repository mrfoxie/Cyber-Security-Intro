## 🔑 **Common Password Mistakes You Should Avoid**

### ❌ 1. **Using Weak Passwords**
- Examples: `123456`, `password`, `qwerty` 
- Easily cracked in seconds by brute force tools

### 🔁 2. **Reusing the Same Password**
- If one site is breached, **all** your accounts are at risk 

### 🧠 3. **Using Personal Information**
- Names, birthdays, or pet names are easy to guess

### 🗒️ 4. **Writing Passwords Down or Storing in Plain Text**
- Sticky notes, unencrypted files, or emails — **major risk**

### 🚫 5. **Never Changing Passwords**
- Especially after an incident or a warning from a service provider

### 📱 6. **Not Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Passwords alone are **not enough** in today’s threat landscape
 
### ⚠️ 7. **Trusting Your Browser to Remember All Passwords**
- Saved passwords can be **extracted by malware**
