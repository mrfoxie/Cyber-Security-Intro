## Why It’s a Risk

    - Spread **malware/links**
    - Launch **phishing or social engineering attacks**
    - Impersonate coworkers or trusted people

## Red Flags of Fake Profiles

- 👤 **Few friends/followers** or very new account
- 📸 **No real photos** (stock images, stolen pics)
- 📝 **Strange grammar** or overly generic posts
- 💼 Pretends to be from your **company/industry** but details don’t match
- ❌ Pushes you to click links, share info, or send money

## Safe Practices

- Don’t accept **unknown friend requests**
- Verify identities via **another channel** (work email, call, in-person)
- Report and block **suspicious profiles**
- Be cautious even if it looks like a **friend/coworker** — accounts can be hacked
- Limit what strangers can see via **privacy settings**

> **Golden Rule:** If you don’t know them in real life or can’t verify them → **Don’t add them.**
