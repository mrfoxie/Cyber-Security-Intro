## 📸 Scenario 1

A picture of your **boarding pass** before a trip.  
👉 Would you post this on Instagram?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

- 🔴 No – it reveals booking details & personal info hackers can use.

## 🎂 Scenario 2

A post saying: _“Excited to celebrate my birthday on 20th August 🎉”_  
👉 Would you post this on Facebook?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

- 🟠 Risky – birthdays are often used as **password reset questions**.

## 🏠 Scenario 3

A selfie at home with your **Wi-Fi router** visible in the background.  
👉 Would you share it on Snapchat?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

- 🔴 No – hackers can zoom in on **router model/serial number**.

## 💼 Scenario 4

A LinkedIn update: _“Thrilled to join XYZ Corp as an IT Manager starting Monday!”_  
👉 Would you share this immediately?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

- 🟢 Yes, but carefully – good for networking, but avoid sharing **exact start dates, office address, or ID photos**.

> **Takeaway:** Always think… _“Does this post give away personal, location, or security info that could be misused?”_
