# ❓ Q&A – Your Questions Matter

👤 **This is your chance to ask:**
- Any doubts about **cybersecurity practices**
- Clarifications on **policies or rules**
- Questions about **real-life scenarios** you face

💡 **Remember:**
- No question is “too small” — if you’re thinking it, others probably are too.    
- If something isn’t clear today, it may lead to mistakes tomorrow.

📩 **Not comfortable asking now?**
- You can always reach out to the **IT/Security team** later.
