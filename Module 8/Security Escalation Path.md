## Security Escalation Path
When a **security issue** is detected, always follow the proper **escalation chain** to make sure the right people respond quickly.
### **Step 1 â€“ Identify & Report Immediately**
- If you see something suspicious (e.g., phishing email, malware, data leak, device theft) â†’ **Do not investigate on your own**.
- Report **immediately** using the fastest method: call hotline, email security team, or raise a helpdesk ticket.

### **Step 2 â€“ Initial Triage (IT Helpdesk / SOC)**
- **IT Helpdesk** (during business hours) or **Security Operations Center (SOC)** (if 24/7) logs the incident.
- They verify severity:
    - ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk** â€“ User mistake, policy clarification, basic troubleshooting.
    - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk** â€“ Malware alert, unusual login, suspicious file.
    - ðŸ”´ **High/Critical Risk** â€“ Data breach, ransomware, system compromise, insider threat.

### **Step 3 â€“ Escalation Chain**
- **User / Employee** â†’ Reports incident.
- **IT Helpdesk / SOC** â†’ First response, logs details.
- **Information Security Team** â†’ Investigates, contains, and mitigates.
- **Management / Compliance / HR** (if needed) â†’ Engaged for policy, legal, or employee-related issues.
- **Executive / Legal Team** â†’ Only for severe incidents (e.g., breach, regulator notification).

### **Step 4 â€“ Communication**
- Employees are updated on actions to take (e.g., reset password, shut down device).
- Management is informed for awareness.
- External authorities/regulators are contacted **only by authorized leadership**.

>**Key Rule:** Always **report up, never ignore, never cover up**. Even if you are unsure, let the **security team decide**.
