## Red Flags to Report

Employees should **immediately report** if they see any of these warning signs:
### 📧 Email & Messaging
- Unexpected **attachments/links** from unknown senders.
- Messages asking for **passwords, money, or gift cards**.
- Poor spelling/grammar, urgent or threatening tone.
- Email sender address doesn’t match the display name.
### 🔑 Account & Access
- Unexpected **login alerts** (e.g., “New login from another country”).
- Being **locked out** of your account without reason.
- Requests to **share credentials**.
### 💻 Device Behavior
- Sudden **slowness, crashes, or overheating**.
- Unknown software/programs installed.
- Persistent **pop-ups or error messages**.
- Security tools (**antivirus, firewall, VPN**) turning off by themselves.
### 📡 Network & Data
- Strange Wi-Fi names that look like company networks.
- Files **missing, renamed, or altered** without action.
- Data showing up in places it shouldn’t (wrong folder, shared by accident).
- Large, unexplained data transfers.  
### 🔌 Physical Security
- Lost or stolen **devices** (laptop, phone, USB).
- Unfamiliar **people inside restricted areas**.

>**Golden Rule:** If something feels **odd, suspicious, or “off”** → **Report it immediately**.  
>Even small red flags can be the start of a bigger security incident.
