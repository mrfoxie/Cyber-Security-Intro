## Password Policy Summary

### ✅ Key Rules
- **Minimum Length**: At least **12 characters** (longer = stronger).
- **Complexity**: Use **uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols**.
- **No Reuse**: Don’t reuse old passwords or the same one across multiple accounts.
- **Unique per Account**: Every system/app should have its own password.
- **Change Compromised Passwords Immediately** – not on a set schedule unless required.
### 🚫 What to Avoid
- Don’t use personal info (birthday, pet’s name, phone number).
- Don’t use common passwords (`123456`, `password`, `qwerty`).
- Don’t share passwords via email, chat, or sticky notes.
### 🛡️ Best Practices
- Use a **password manager** to store and generate secure passwords.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.
- Regularly review accounts and **remove unused credentials**.

>**Remember**: Strong passwords = stronger defense. A weak password is like leaving the front door unlocked.
