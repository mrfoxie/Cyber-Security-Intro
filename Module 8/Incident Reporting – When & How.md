## When to Report

Report **immediately** if you notice:
- 📩 **Suspicious emails** (phishing, strange attachments, urgent money requests).
- 🔑 **Unauthorized access** (unexpected login alerts, files changed/deleted).
- 💻 **Device issues** (sudden slowness, pop-ups, unusual programs).
- 🔌 **Lost/stolen devices** (laptops, phones, USB drives with company data).
- 📡 **Network anomalies** (unexpected VPN disconnects, strange traffic).
- 🗂️ **Data leaks** (accidental file share, sending sensitive info to the wrong person).

## How to Report
1. **Act Fast** – don’t wait, even if unsure.
2. **Use Official Channels**:
    - 📧 Email the **IT/Security team** (e.g., security@company.com).
    - 📞 Call the **helpdesk/security hotline** if urgent.
    - 📝 Submit via company **incident reporting portal/app**.
3. **Provide Details**:
    - What happened (suspicious email, device missing, etc.).
    - When it happened (date/time).
    - Where you noticed it (home, office, VPN).
    - Screenshots/logs (if safe to capture).
4. **Do Not Investigate Alone** – avoid opening suspicious files, clicking unknown links, or deleting evidence.
