## You’re Part of the Defense

### 🔑 What It Means:
- Security is not just IT’s job — **everyone plays a role**.    
- One mistake (like clicking a phishing link) can open the door for attackers.
- One smart action (like reporting a suspicious email) can **stop an attack**.

### 👩‍💻 How You Help:
- **Think before you click** links or attachments.
- **Protect passwords** — never share them.
- **Report anything odd** (emails, USBs, calls, websites).
- **Follow company rules** for handling data.

> Visual idea: Show a **castle wall** with employees as the bricks 🧱, making the defense strong together.
